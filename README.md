# Polyglot
Translate you app strings using GCloud.

## Why GCloud?
This is meant to compare GCloud translations against translations obtained by professional vendors. Vendors are given context for each string given vendors an advantage in providing the most correct translation. Vendors are also subject to human error and may return strings with typos or grammatical errors. Unlike vendors, GCloud translations are nearly instant and very low cost.

## Access Token
You must have a GCloud access token to use Polyglot. The GCloud SDK will generate and print your access token with:

    gcloud auth print-access-token

## ToDo
This is a work in progress and currently only supports Android `string.xml` files.
